TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

The following license governs the use of this software in non-commercial academic environments. 

Definitions “Program” means a copy of cancer_markers repository, which is said to be distributed under this Academic
Public License.

The Program can be used in research activities, within individual use, and exclusively for non-commercial purpose.

“Work based on the Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.)

“Using the Program” means any act of creating executables that contain or directly use libraries that are part of the
Program, running any of the tools that are part of the Program, or creating works based on the Program.

Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

1. Permission is hereby granted to use the Program free of charge for any noncommercial purpose, including teaching and
   research at universities, colleges and other educational institutions, research at non-profit research institutions,
   and personal non-profit purposes. For using the Program for commercial purposes, including but not restricted to
   consulting activities, design of commercial hardware or software networking products, and a commercial entity
   participating in research projects, you have to contact the Author for an appropriate license. Permission is also
   granted to use the Program for a reasonably limited period of time for the purpose of evaluating its usefulness for a
   particular purpose.

2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
   that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
   warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
   other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
   copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 2 above, provided that you also meet all of
   these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
   any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
   Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
   License.

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
   the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
   its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the
   same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the
   terms of this License, whose regulations for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
   part regardless of who wrote it.
   (If the same, independent sections are distributed as part of a package that is otherwise reliant on, or is based on
   the Program, then the distribution of the whole package, including but not restricted to the independent section,
   must be on the unmodified terms of this License, regardless of who the author of the included sections was.)

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
   rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based or
   reliant on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program
   (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work
   under the scope of this License.

4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 3) in object code or executable form
   under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
   terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
   than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
   source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a medium customarily used for software
   interchange; or,

   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
   (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code
   or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b) above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable
   work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
   special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
   source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
   of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
   offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. Any attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program in any other way than specified in this license is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license. However, parties who have received copies or
   rights from you under this license will not lose their license as long as these parties fully comply with the terms.

6. You do not have to accept this license because you have not signed it. However, if you want to change or distribute
   the Program (or a work based on the Program), you automatically consent to this license and all its terms for
   copying, distributing or changing the program or the works based upon it.

7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically acquires a
   license from the initial licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program in accordance with these terms and
   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted here. You
   are not responsible for ensuring that this license is enforced by third parties.

8. If, as a result of a court decision or violation of a patent right, or for any other reason (not limited to patent
   issues), conditions are imposed that conflict with the terms of this license, you will not be released from the terms
   of this license. If you cannot distribute the Program because you would have to meet obligations under this license
   and other obligations at the same time, you may not distribute the Program at all.

9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program in certain countries is restricted either by patents or by copyrighted
   interfaces, the original copyright holder who puts the Program under this license may add an explicit geographic
   distribution restriction that excludes these countries. In this case, this license contains the restriction as if it
   was written in the body of this license.

NO WARRANTY

10. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
    PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

11. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED ON IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
    WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES, OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
